I am currently a student at WGU pursuing my Bachelors Degree in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance 
## Objective

My journey in cybersecurity has led me to develop a passion for offensive and defensive security, I am really passionate about Penetration Testing and Defensive Security, as well as GRC Security Advisor and Internal Auditing and I am an avid participant in CTF Challenges. I am now eager to break into the industry, specifically aiming to join a Red Team or a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
